"""(3c) Write a brief explanation (4-5 sentences) on how the ElectricCar class demonstrates 
the principles of modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

Modularity : ElectricCar inherits from the Car class and this separates common car properties from ElectricCar separate ones. This keeps the code organized and easier to understand

Reusability : By inheriting from the Car class, ElectricCar reuses existing code for displaying car information.This avoids code duplication and promotes efficiency

Maintainability : Adding new electric car features becomes easier. One can simply add new methods specific to electric cars within ElectricCar without modifying the core car functionality in Car

"""(4b).
What differences did you notice between the OOP and procedural implementations?

OOP uses encapsulation within objects while procedural programming uses separate entities

Procedural programming doesn't support inheritance while OOP supports inheritance

Procedural programming comprises of functions while OOP comprises of objects

In procedural programming code is typically divided into modules or subroutines while OOP is typically divided into classes and objects"""


"""How does OOP provide benefits like modularity, reusability, and maintainability compared to procedural programming?

OOP has modularity provides encapsulation of data and methods that are used within the class and this creates organized self contained units while procedural programming functions are all separated

OPP enables reusability of methods and attributes like in the case of inheritance a child class is able to reuse the methods and attributes of its parent class while this functionality is no available in procedural programming

OOP provides easier maintainability in terms of modifications ie; changes can be made to specific objects or their methods without affecting the entire program, reducing the risk of unintended side effects while this is not applicable in procedural programming."""
